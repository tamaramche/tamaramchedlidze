	<meta name="description" content="Path following is one of the basic tasks that a user performs with a graph drawing. In several user studies, including eye-tracking (Huang 2007) and controlled experiments (Huang et al 2009), it was confirmed that people have geodesic-path tendency, that is they tend to follow edges that lead in the direction of the target vertex. Inspired by this finding, in 2010, Angelini et al.  defined a new paradigm for graph visualization.  A drawing  of a graph is  monotone if for every pair of vertices u and v there is a path from u to v such that the drawing of path implied by the drawing  is monotone. 

Note that a drawing of a path  is monotone if there is an oriented line  such that the vertices of the path appear in the orthogonal projection on the line in the same order as they are listed by the path. Refer to the figure below.

		<p><em>Path following</em> is one of the basic tasks that a user performs with a graph drawing. In several user studies, including eye-tracking (Huang 2007) and controlled experiments (Huang et al 2009), it was confirmed that people have <em>geodesic-path tendency</em>, that is they tend to follow edges that lead in the direction of the target vertex. Inspired by this finding, in 2010, Angelini et al.  defined a new paradigm for graph visualization.  A drawing  of a graph is  <em>monotone</em> if for every pair of vertices u and v there is a path from u to v such that the drawing of path implied by the drawing  is monotone.

Note that a drawing of a path  is <em>monotone</em> if there is an oriented line  such that the vertices of the path appear in the orthogonal projection on the line in the same order as they are listed by the path. Refer to the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/monotone.svg" alt="Monotone drawing of a path" class="blog.blog-post__textimage" /></p>

<p>Since the introduction of this notion,  researchers have mostly concentrated on planar monotone drawings. In particular the following problem have been thoroughly studied: given a planar graph, decide whether it has a planar monotone drawing. 
For instance, graph on the following picture does not has a planar monotone drawing without flipping out of the circle the vertices of degree one,
because every path between those vertices has to be as shown on the right.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nonmono.svg" alt="Monotone drawing of a path" class="blog.blog-post__textimage" /></p>

<p>In the order of reference below: I have studied monotone drawings of planar graphs and <em>strongly monotone drawings</em> of planar graphs, where the direction of monotonicity of a path is defined by the line between its end-points. I have also studies so-called <em>simultaneous drawings</em> of planar graphs, where a few graphs are drawn in monotone way using the same set of location for vertices. The last reference is devoted to monotone simultanous drawings in higher dimension.<br />
Finally, I have also studied <em>greedy drawings</em>, a notion closely relevant to monotone drawings, encomassing a different definition of a path that suits well the path-following task.</p>
